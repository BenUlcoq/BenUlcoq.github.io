                                <span>Published 1st September</span>
                              </div>
                              </div>
                                <p>It’s now week two of the Fast Track Bootcamp at Coder Academy in Brisbane and already there are some tired eyes and minds in the classroom.
                                </p><p>
                                    I was lucky enough to score some tickets to Wordcamp Brisbane (Big shout out to Steph!) which was held at QUT over the weekend. There was a whole heap of awesome information to take in with a host of awesome presenters at the event. Much of it was flying over my head but it was exciting seeing all of the amazing things happening across the industry.
                                  </p><p>
                                    Although the day to day early wake up and commute was a bit of a shock to the system at first, I’ve started to adjust (thanks in no small part to coffee!). 
                                  </p><p>
                                    The bootcamp is well and truly getting into gear now as we’ve been learning all about the powerful things we can do with object oriented programming.
                                  </p><p>
                                    Although it hasn’t been easy jamming so much into my brain at once, the course structure has made learning a fairly smooth process. So although I don’t find myself struggling for motivation at this point, I certainly have found myself being inspired. And it’s not come from where I expected it.
                                  </p><p>
                                    The bootcamp attracts a diverse range of people from all walks of life and it instantly becomes obvious that everyone learns different things at their own pace. Where some might have excelled at loops and flow control, they might now struggle a little with composition and inheritance.
                                  </p><p>
                                    What I’ve found incredible to watch is that, of those struggling at any given time, no one has a defeatist attitude. Perhaps even more awesome to see is that those around them offer support and guidance readily. 
                                  </p><p>
                                    So, with a long way still to go I’m glad to be surrounded by a wonderful group of people who are inspiring me everyday. <br><span>Photo by rawpixel.com from Pexels</span></p>

                                    <span>Published 26th August</span>
                                  </div>
                                  </div>
                                    <p>When I sat down in the Coder Academy classroom on Monday morning I wasn’t sure what to expect. All I knew as that I was ready to jump into the world of programming, Ruby, loops and everything in between…</p><p>
                                      <strong>“You need to get Twitter!”</strong></p><p>
                                      At first I thought maybe I’d mistakenly ended up in the wrong classroom. It wouldn’t have been too far-fetched; I’d only arrived in Brisbane 4 days prior after moving from the (relatively) sleepy Central Queensland town of Rockhampton. The early start had me feeling a little groggy.</p><p>
                                      After coming to my senses a bit more, I found out I was in fact in the right place. What I discovered was that my outlook for the course (and beyond!) was naive. Apparently there’s so much more to coding than sitting in a dark corner with headphones on plugging away at a keyboard endlessly!</p><p>
                                      Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating my naivety a little bit.</p><p>
                                      But I certainly wasn’t expecting there to be meetups and networking events nearly every single day (with PIZZA AND BEER). I had the fantastic experience of attending a Sectalks event last night. I tagged along with fellow ‘developer in the making’ Santiago (Check out his great posts here!). Although most of the presentation flew way over my head it was extremely interesting getting a sneak-peek into some of the things happening in and around Brisbane. There’s a bunch of awesome people doing some pretty amazing things every day and I can’t wait to immerse myself even further into the world of Brisbane tech.</p><p>
                                      All of this and I’ve barely even touched on the course itself! But hey, there’s sure to be plenty of that to come.</p><p>
                                      If you’re interested in getting some insight into a coding bootcamp at Coder Academy and life in Brisbane in general then keep an eye out — I’ll be posting here about my journey throughout the course.</p><p>
