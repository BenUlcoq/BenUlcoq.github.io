                  Sources of motivation at a Coding Bootcamp
                </h3>
                <span>Published 1st September</span>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              It’s now week two of the Fast Track Bootcamp at Coder Academy in
              Brisbane and already there are some tired eyes and minds in the
              classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was lucky enough to score some tickets to Wordcamp Brisbane (Big
              shout out to Steph!) which was held at QUT over the weekend. There
              was a whole heap of awesome information to take in with a host of
              awesome presenters at the event. Much of it was flying over my
              head but it was exciting seeing all of the amazing things
              happening across the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the day to day early wake up and commute was a bit of a
              shock to the system at first, I’ve started to adjust (thanks in no
              small part to coffee!).
            </p>
            <p>
              The bootcamp is well and truly getting into gear now as we’ve been
              learning all about the powerful things we can do with object
              oriented programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it hasn’t been easy jamming so much into my brain at
              once, the course structure has made learning a fairly smooth
              process. So although I don’t find myself struggling for motivation
              at this point, I certainly have found myself being inspired. And
              it’s not come from where I expected it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bootcamp attracts a diverse range of people from all walks of
              life and it instantly becomes obvious that everyone learns
              different things at their own pace. Where some might have excelled
              at loops and flow control, they might now struggle a little with
              composition and inheritance.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I’ve found incredible to watch is that, of those struggling
              at any given time, no one has a defeatist attitude. Perhaps even
              more awesome to see is that those around them offer support and
              guidance readily.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, with a long way still to go I’m glad to be surrounded by a
              wonderful group of people who are inspiring me everyday.

            <p>
              When I sat down in the Coder Academy classroom on Monday morning I
              wasn’t sure what to expect. All I knew as that I was ready to jump
              into the world of programming, Ruby, loops and everything in
              between…
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>“You need to get Twitter!”</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              At first I thought maybe I’d mistakenly ended up in the wrong
              classroom. It wouldn’t have been too far-fetched; I’d only arrived
              in Brisbane 4 days prior after moving from the (relatively) sleepy
              Central Queensland town of Rockhampton. The early start had me
              feeling a little groggy.
            </p>
            <p>
              After coming to my senses a bit more, I found out I was in fact in
              the right place. What I discovered was that my outlook for the
              course (and beyond!) was naive. Apparently there’s so much more to
              coding than sitting in a dark corner with headphones on plugging
              away at a keyboard endlessly!

              Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating my naivety a little bit.

              But I certainly wasn’t expecting there to be meetups and
              networking events nearly every single day (with PIZZA AND BEER). I
              had the fantastic experience of attending a Sectalks event last
              night. I tagged along with fellow ‘developer in the making’
              Santiago (Check out his great posts here!). Although most of the
              presentation flew way over my head it was extremely interesting
              getting a sneak-peek into some of the things happening in and
              around Brisbane. There’s a bunch of awesome people doing some
              pretty amazing things every day and I can’t wait to immerse myself
              even further into the world of Brisbane tech.

              All of this and I’ve barely even touched on the course itself! But
              hey, there’s sure to be plenty of that to come.

              If you’re interested in getting some insight into a coding
              bootcamp at Coder Academy and life in Brisbane in general then
              keep an eye out — I’ll be posting here about my journey throughout
              the course.
